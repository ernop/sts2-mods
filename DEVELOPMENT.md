# FlatMap & DeckView — development environment

Everything here is about *inspecting the game* and *building the mod*. It is
deliberately explicit so nobody has to rediscover it. This repo runs from WSL
(Linux) but the toolchain is the Windows one under `/mnt/c`.

## Compatibility policy: preflight, then enable all-or-nothing

`Runtime/ModRuntime.cs` (per mod) validates every private/string-named game member before
Harmony applies a patch (`HookCatalog.FindMissing`). Missing members produce one
explicit `DISABLED` log with the full list, and STS2 continues with its vanilla UI.
If `PatchAll` fails partway, the mod calls `UnpatchAll(HarmonyId)`; every callback
also checks `ModRuntime.Enabled`, so even an unsuccessful rollback cannot run a
half-enabled feature. This preflight revert-with-warning runs in **all** builds.

**Strict (dev) vs public — the failure mode differs, controlled by `PUBLIC_BUILD`:**
- **Dev/local build (default):** an unexpected error in *our own* patch/input/draw
  code **re-throws (crashes loudly)** — we never mask our own bugs. This is the
  "work or crash" rule for us.
- **Public release build (`-p:PublicBuild=true`, set by `scripts/package.ps1`;
  `build.ps1 -Public`):** those same boundaries **revert to vanilla with a warning**
  instead of crashing a player's game (we can't control their STS2 version).
- Functionally identical on a correct version + correct code; only the failure mode
  differs. Do in-game checks on a normal `build.ps1` build; `package.ps1` rebuilds the
  public variant into the archive.

Keep `HookCatalog` and `scripts/verify-hooks.sh` synchronized whenever a game
integration changes.

## The game

- Install root: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Slay the Spire 2\`
  (from WSL: `/mnt/c/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Slay the Spire 2/`).
- Managed DLLs live in `…\Slay the Spire 2\data_sts2_windows_x86_64\`.
  The mod references `sts2.dll`, `GodotSharp.dll`, `0Harmony.dll` from there
  (reference-only — nothing is bundled or copied).
- Current compatibility target: game version **v0.109.0**.

## Decompiler (how to read game internals)

We have **no bundled decompiled source** — decompile on demand from `sts2.dll`.

- Tool: **ilspycmd** (ICSharpCode.Decompiler CLI), installed as a *Windows*
  dotnet global tool at:
  `/mnt/c/Users/ernes/.dotnet/tools/ilspycmd.exe`  (version 8.2.0.7535)
- It is a Windows exe; invoke it directly from WSL with the full path.

```bash
ILSPY="/mnt/c/Users/ernes/.dotnet/tools/ilspycmd.exe"
DLL="C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\Slay the Spire 2\\data_sts2_windows_x86_64\\sts2.dll"

# List every type (Class/Struct/Enum … with fully-qualified names):
"$ILSPY" -l c "$DLL"

# Decompile one (or several) fully-qualified types to C# on stdout:
"$ILSPY" -t "MegaCrit.Sts2.Core.Nodes.Screens.Map.NMapScreen" "$DLL"
"$ILSPY" -t "MegaCrit.Sts2.Core.Map.ActMap" -t "MegaCrit.Sts2.Core.Map.MapPoint" "$DLL"
```

Notes:
- `-t` on a big type can take a couple of minutes — allow up to ~5 min per call.
- `scripts/verify-hooks.sh` uses `ilspycmd` from `PATH`, then the maintainer default above.
  Set `ILSPY` and `STS2_DLL` to override either path.
- Reinstall if ever missing:
  `"/mnt/c/Program Files/dotnet/dotnet.exe" tool install --global ilspycmd --version 8.2.0.7535`
  (the bare `latest` package has a broken `DotnetToolSettings.xml`; pin the version).

## Building

- Building the mod itself requires the Windows game assemblies. From WSL, use the
  Windows SDK at `/mnt/c/Program Files/dotnet/dotnet.exe`. Public CI can use Linux
  .NET for the game-independent layout tests.
- Normal build is the PowerShell script (runs the Windows dotnet + installs both mods into
  the game's `mods\flatmap\` and `mods\deckview\`):

```powershell
# from a Windows shell, repo root:
.\scripts\build.ps1 -Install
```

  From WSL you can drive the same thing via:
  `"/mnt/c/Program Files/dotnet/dotnet.exe" build flatmap.csproj -c Release -o bin`
  then copy each mod's DLL + manifest into
  `…\Slay the Spire 2\mods\<id>\`.
- The csproj resolves the game DLL folder from `-p:Sts2Data=…`, the `STS2_DATA`
  env var, or the default install path (in that order).
- After building: launch STS2 → Mods menu → enable the mod(s) → restart (Godot
  compiles mods on startup). Launch with `--nomods` for a vanilla A/B comparison.
- Package an in-game-tested DLL with `.\scripts\package.ps1`; see `PUBLISHING.md`.

## Source organization

The repo hosts **two fully independent mods** (separate DLLs, manifests, Harmony ids, configs,
hook preflights — no shared assembly):

**FlatMap (map), repo root:**
- `FlatMapMod.cs` — map controller, Harmony patch boundaries, and map rendering.
- `Runtime/ModRuntime.cs` — compatibility catalog, guarded Harmony lifecycle, reflection helpers.
- `Config/FlatMapConfig.cs` — persisted user settings and debug opt-ins (`user://flatmap.cfg`;
  first run migrates the flat preference from the legacy `user://deckview.cfg`).
- `UI/ToggleSwitch.cs` — game-native toggles and keyboard/controller activation.
- `layout/` — pure map layout algorithm and property-test executable.

**DeckView (deck zoom), `deckview/`:**
- `deckview/DeckViewMod.cs` — card shrink patches, hover reconcile, on-screen toggle.
- `deckview/Runtime/ModRuntime.cs`, `deckview/Config/DeckViewConfig.cs`
  (`user://deckview.cfg`, the historical location), `deckview/UI/`.

The small runtime/toggle boilerplate is deliberately duplicated per mod ("completely separate"
was the design goal); keep the copies textually close so diffs stay reviewable.
`scripts/build.ps1` builds both (`-Only <id>` to limit); `scripts/package.ps1` archives both.

Keep game-independent logic in `layout/`. If map rendering grows further, split model extraction
and rendering into separate `Map/` files without moving reflection or patch lifecycle back into
feature code.

## Map data model (reference for the minimap work)

Decompile these when touching the map feature (see the classes for exact private
field names — they are what we reflect into):
- `NMapScreen` — on-screen map. `_mapPointDictionary` (`Dictionary<MapCoord,
  NMapPoint>`) is every on-screen point; `_mapContainer`/`_points` are the node
  parents; `_targetDragPos` is the scroll target (the container's `Position.Y`
  lerps toward it every frame and is clamped to `[-600, 1800]` — setting
  `_mapContainer.Position` directly does nothing). There is **no zoom field**.
- `ActMap` / `MapPoint` / `StandardActMap` — the data model. `MapPoint.coord`
  (`MapCoord{col,row}`), `MapPoint.PointType` (`MapPointType`), `MapPoint.Children`
  / `parents` (edges). Enumerate `GetAllMapPoints()` ∪ `StartingMapPoint` ∪
  `BossMapPoint` (∪ `SecondBossMapPoint`).
- Live run access: `RunManager.Instance` → private prop `State` (`RunState`,
  implements public `IRunState`) → `.Map`, `.CurrentMapCoord`, `.VisitedMapCoords`.
- `MapPointType` enum: `Unassigned, Unknown, Shop, Treasure, RestSite, Monster,
  Elite, Boss, Ancient`.
